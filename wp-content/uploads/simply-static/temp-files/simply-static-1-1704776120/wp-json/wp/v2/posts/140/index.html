I love the feel and sophistication of its superiority. I like people with a keen mind and at the same time easy to talk to. These qualities can be combined perfectly natural. However, things like people look miserable, if these properties are connected to them artificially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern design and a lack of love dilettantism. Looking for such&nbsp;<a href=\\\\\\\"#\\\\\\\">designers<\/a>, which all use a little beauty and no matter how much they looked around either; which you always want to do something else. Designers do not only&nbsp;<a href=\\\\\\\"#\\\\\\\">image-makers<\/a>, but also dreamers who tell stories and think.
